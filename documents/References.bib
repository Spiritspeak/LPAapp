	abstract = {Finite mixture models are being used increasingly to model a wide variety of random phenomena for clustering, classification and density estimation. mclust is a powerful and popular package which allows modelling of data as a Gaussian finite mixture with different covariance structures and different numbers of mixture components, for a variety of purposes of analysis. Recently, version 5 of the package has been made available on {CRAN}. This updated version adds new covariance structures, dimension reduction capabilities for visualisation, model selection criteria, initialisation strategies for the {EM} algorithm, and bootstrap-based inference, making it a full-featured R package for data analysis via finite mixture modelling.},

@thesis{erar_mixture_2011,
	title = {Mixture model cluster analysis under different covariance structures using information complexity},
	abstract = {In this thesis, a mixture-model cluster analysis technique under different covariance structures of the component densities is developed and presented, to capture the compactness, orientation, shape, and the volume of component clusters in one expert system to handle Gaussian high dimensional heterogeneous data sets to achieve flexibility in currently practiced cluster analysis techniques. Two approaches to parameter estimation are considered and compared; one using the Expectation-Maximization ({EM}) algorithm and another following a Bayesian framework using the Gibbs sampler. We develop and score several forms of the {ICOMP} criterion of Bozdogan (1994, 2004) as our fitness function; to choose the number of component clusters, to choose the correct component covariance matrix structure among nine candidate covariance structures, and to select the optimal parameters and the best fitting mixture-model. We demonstrate our approach on simulated datasets and a real large data set, focusing on early detection of breast cancer. We show that our approach improves the probability of classification error over the existing methods.},
